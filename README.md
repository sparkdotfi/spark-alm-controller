## Overview

This repo contains the onchain components of the Bloom Liquidity Layer. The following contracts are contained in this repository:

- `ALMProxy`: The proxy contract that holds custody of all funds. This contract routes calls to external contracts according to logic within a specified `controller` contract. This pattern was used to allow for future iterations in logic, as a new controller can be onboarded and can route calls through the proxy with new logic. This contract is stateless except for the ACL logic contained within the inherited OpenZeppelin `AccessControl` contract.
- `MainnetController`: This controller contract is intended to be used on the Ethereum mainnet.
- `RateLimits`: This contract is used to enforce and update rate limits on logic in the `MainnetController` contract. This contract is stateful and is used to store the rate limit data.
